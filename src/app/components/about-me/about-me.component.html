    Hi! I'm a final-year B.Tech student at KIIT University, having recently completed my third year. 
    I'm a fresher software engineer with a strong passion for building full-stack applications using the MERN stack.
    My skill set includes working with relational and NoSQL databases, and I enjoy designing efficient, scalable data structures to power modern web apps.

  <p class="text-slate max-w-xl text-lg mb-4" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="200"> 
    Beyond web development, I'm deeply interested in Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, and cloud-native technologies.
    I also have a growing curiosity in data analysis, finding insights that drive smarter decision-making.
